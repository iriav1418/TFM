plant_id,Identification for plant
family,Unique name for the plant's genetic family. Families were created by reciprocal cross-pollination of two plants from the same accession. These pollinations occurred from August 2020-March 2021. The resulting seeds produced by both crossed plants (i.e. two parent plants) were bulk mixed to produce each family. Accessions were sourced from the USDA US National Plant Germplasm System (https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/).
planting_event,"Reflects the spacio-temporal block of the plant, i.e. the time it was planted and the bench it was located on in the greenhouse. 'A' plants were planted 21-28 April, 'B' plants were planted on 13-21 May, and 'C' plants were planted on 21-28 May 2021."
rhizobia_treatment,"Rhizobia treatment applied to plant. 'strain_4386' signifies that the plant was applied 1mL of Tryptone Yeast (TY) Broth containing 1*10^8 cells of R. leguminosarum strain 4386 (obtained from the USDA ARS Culture Collection-Northern Regional Research Lab, accession number: NRRL B-4386); 'strain_14479' indicates the plant was applied 1mL of TY Broth containing 1*10^8 cells/mL of R. leguminosarum strain 14479 (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, accession number: 14479); 'uninoculated' (abbreviation for signifies that the plant was applied 1mL of sterile TY Broth"
dicamba_treatment,"Dicamba herbicide treatment applied to plant. Control indicates the plant was spayed with 0.1% volume/volume mixture of Preference surfactant (non-ionic surfactant blend, WinField Solutions, St. Paul, MN) and water. 'full' indicates the plant was sprayed with the field label rate (560 g acid equivalent per hectare[ha]) of dicamba herbicide (3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid, Albaugh, LLC, Ankeny, IA) and 0.1% volume/volume mixture of Preference surfactant. Drift indicates the plant was sprayed with 1% of the field label rate of dicamba (5.6 g acid equivalent dicamba/ha) and 0.1% volume/volume mixture of Preference surfactant. "
pre_leaf_num,"Number of leaves counted during 'pre' data collection for the plant. Each Leaflet on a true leaf (there are three leaflets per true leaf in T. pratense) was counted as a leaf. Cotelydons (T. pratense typically has two at the base of the plant) were not counted. Leaflets were only counted if they were mostly green or yellow and still attached to the plant, i.e. dried, brown leaflets were not counted."
pre_leaf_size,"Estimate of the size of the plant's leaves. Units are in millimeters. To estimate leaf size, we measured the longest dimension (typically length) on the biggest leaflet with a digital caliper. "
num_nodules_picX,"Number of root nodules counted on photographs of plant roots using Fiji (also called ImageJ) software. 'picX' denotes the number shown in the photograph on the paper label, e.g. if the photo has a piece of paper with ""picture 1"" written on it, then the number of nodules counted on that photo would be entered into the 'num_noduels_pic1' column. Multiple pictures were often taken for a single plant because the roots were too large to fit on one sheet. Missing data signifies that pictures of plant's roots were not taken"
Cornell_delta_15N,"Corrected isotope delta value for isotope 15-nitrogen measured against a primary reference scale (Atmospheric Air) of plants' leaf samples. Delta values are measured in units of per mil(%). Data was provided by the Cornell University Stable Isotope Facility (Ithaca, NY, USA). "
nodules_biomass_mg,"Weight in mg of the sample of nodules randomly selected from the plant. Nodules were sampled by making a transect with a ruler across the root system of plants and ranodmly selecting 10 nodules every ~2 in. across the transect. Nodule samples were weighed on the microbalance. ""NA"" means nodule samples were not collected for this plant."
num_nodules_weighed,"Number of nodules that were recorded during weighing to produce the data found in 'nodules_biomass_mg' column. ""NA"" means nodule samples were not collected for this plant. "
post3wk_death,"Denotes with a ""Y"" which plants among those treated with the 'full' dicamba treatment were noted as appearing dead at 3 weeks post-treatment. ""N"" siginifies that the plant was not showing signs of imminent death and ""NA"" was entered for plants that were not treated with the full dicamba treatment."
